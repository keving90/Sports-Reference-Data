# Sports-Reference-Data
This repository contains Python programs capable of scraping data from [Sports-Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/) websites. Examples of such websites include [Pro-Football-Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) and [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), among others.

I plan on adding a more detailed write-up and demonstration here.
